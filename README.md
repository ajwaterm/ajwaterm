- 👋 Hi, I’m Alex @ajwaterm
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code! I've watched tutorials and taken udemy classes, but now I want to start working on my own projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding on python. My next 2 goals are pushing my beginner tic-tac-toe project to GitHub (to practice), followed by creating a web application that will act as a resume. This will involve learning a web framework, and I've chosen Flask as my package to learn.
- 💞️ I’m looking to receive feedback on code that I've worked on. I know there are ways to improve, I am happy to receive feedback on any code that I have pushed up! 
- 📫 I can be reached at ajwater6@gmail.com. I will try to respond within a day.
